## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The project follows a feature-first architecture, separating core functionalities from distinct feature modules. This approach promotes modularity, scalability, and easier maintenance. Each feature (e.g., `chat_bot`, `local_meals`, `online_meals`) is self-contained with its own data, repository, and presentation layers, using the BLoC pattern for state management.
